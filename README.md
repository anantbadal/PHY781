# **PHY781: High Energy Physics**

## (Advanced Quantum Field Theory)

### **Instructor:** Arjun Bagchi (abagchi@iitk.ac.in)

#### **Prerequisites:** PHY681 (Quantum Field Theory)

**Summary:** This is a second course on Quantum Field Theory (QFT). QFT is one of the fundamental tools of modern physics with broad ranging applications in all of theoretical physics including condensed matter physics, particle physics, and other areas of high energy physics. 

This course is structured as follows. We first briefly cover quantization for constrained systems, and rederive aspects of Quantum Electrodynamics. We then consider classical aspects of Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories. The second part introduces the path integral formulation and reconsiders the quantization of scalar, fermionic and electromagnetic theories in this formulation. We then use these methods for Yang-Mills theories. The last part of the course deals with renormalization. Answers to various processes in QFT often turn out to be infinite. Regularization and renormalization are used to extract physical answers out of these infinites. This course will lay out these formal procedures and show how to renormalize various QFTs.
